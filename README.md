more than 200 pictures of Ayacucho, Peru

On behalf of the DAAD I worked at the UNSCH (Universidad Nacional de San Cristobal de Huamanga) in Ayacucho from April to July 2022.

Ayacucho is the capital of the province of Ayacucho, one of 24 in Peru, and has almost 100,000 inhabitants.
I saw the transformation of the cityscape from the centre to the periphery, the regional architecture,
the grandiose topography of the high mountains (2500m in the northeast of the city, 3300m at the Corazon),
countless popular festivals and pictures of everyday life.
